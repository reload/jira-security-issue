# Reload Jira Security Issue

This is a small library that can create Jira issues. The main idea is
that it's simple to use and it'll not recreate an issue if the proper
keys are supplied.

Quick example:

``` php
        $issue = new JiraSecurityIssue();

        $issue->setTitle('Issue title')
            ->setBody('The main body');

        $issue->setKeyLabel('some-unique-id');

        echo $issue->ensure();
```

Configuration is set using environment variables, for ease of use in
CI systems.
